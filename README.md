Scores:
Assignment 1: 100
  Grading Breakdown:
      (0) The automatic running of your program gave you 90.
      (1) Output file attached: 8
      (2) Other compiling issues: 2
      
Assignment 2: 95 
  Grading Breakdown:
    (1) Running of the program: out of 80 you got 80
    (2) The private member variables: out of 10 you got 10
    (3) Invariant: out of 10 you got  5 (Please read the instruction more carefully: The Invariant should be stated in the implementation file)
    
Assignment 3: 110
  Grading Breakdown:
    (1) Running of the program: out of 60 you got 60
    (2) The private member variables: out of 10 you got 10
    (3) Invariant : out of 10 you got  10
    (4) Value semantics: out of 10 you got 10  
    (5) Compiling warnings and code style: out of 10 you got 10
    (6) Operators +, += and []: out of 10 bonus points you got  10
Assignemnt 4: 99
  Grading Breakdown:
  Basis points (70) if your implementation passes the seq_ex3 exam: 70

Assignment 5: 100
  Grading Breakdown:
  1. One Binary Number: out of 25 you got: 25
- recursive case: out of 10 you got:10
- stopping case:out of 10 you got:10
- no leading zeros: out of 5 you got:5

2. Triangle Pattern: out of 25 you got:25
- Precondition: out of 5 you got: 5

- stopping case(two lines, and the way you print *): out of 10 you got:10


3. Pow Function: out of 25 you got:25
- Precondition: out of 5 you got:5
- recursive case (negative, odd and even numbers): out of 15 you got:15
- stopping cases (n=0 and n=1): out of 5 you got: 5

4. Repeated and Indented Sentences: out of 25 you got:25
- Precondition: out of 5 you got:5
- recursive case: out of 10 you got:10
- stopping case(two lines, intents, line number): out of 10 you got:10

Assignment 6: 100 
  Grading Breakdown:
   max(40, your actual points) =max(40, 80) = 80
   Invariant of the class and other things (10 points): 10
   If you submitted the output of your program (10 points) :10
